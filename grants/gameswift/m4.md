### Description

Details of what will be delivered:
- bridge will allow to migrate ERC-20 (CEP-18) tokens and non-fungible ERC-721 (CEP-47, CEP-78) tokens between GameSwift Chain and Casper,
- the backend application will be based on events emitted on chains,
- the bridging process from Casper to GameSwift will look like:
 - when a user deposits tokens on the bridge, the contract on Casper emits an event which is caught by the listener
 - the tokens are locked on the Casper chain
 - the listener prepares and broadcasts a transaction which will emit an event on the GS chain containing information about the token address and destination
address
 - the relayer catches the event and mints the tokens on the destination address
- the bridging process from GameSwift to Casper will look like:
 - when a user deposits tokens on the bridge, the contract on Casper emits an event which is caught by the listener
 - the tokens are burned
 - the listener prepares and broadcasts a transaction which will emit an event on the Casper chain containing information about the token address and destination
address
 - the relayer catches the event and sends the locked tokens to the destination address
- the bridge contract has to be secured against multiple calls and have permissions for the admin, listeners, and relayers.
- frontend application based on `react-js` with features
 - connect metamask
 - connect Casper Wallet
 - bridge example token between Casper chain and GameSwift Chain

### Acceptance Criteria
- This milestone will be considered completed if all the functionalities listed above are correctly implemented as part of the integration of GameSwift solutions with Casper Network.
- Acceptance assumes that the solution will be available for testing by selected Casper members.
